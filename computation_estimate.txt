Computation Estimate for solver_les.py
--------------------------------------

This file estimates the total number of computational operations performed by the LES solver in `solver_les.py` for the WingFlowLES simulation.

Key Parameters:
- Grid size: 600 x 400 = 240,000 cells
- Total time steps: 60,000
- Internal cells (excluding boundaries): ~237,604

Operations per Time Step:
1. Smagorinsky Model (ν_t): ~5.7 million operations
   - Strain rate and eddy viscosity for 237,604 cells.
2. Predictor Step (u*, v*): ~9.7 million operations
   - Convection and diffusion terms.
3. Pressure Solver: ~143 million operations
   - Iterative Poisson solver, ~50 iterations per step.
4. Corrector Step (u, v update): ~2.6 million operations
   - Pressure gradient correction.
5. Boundary Conditions: ~6,000 operations
   - Inlet, outlet, and slip conditions.

Total per Step: ~161 million operations

Total for Simulation:
- 161 million operations/step x 60,000 steps ≈ 9.67 trillion operations (9.67 × 10^12)
